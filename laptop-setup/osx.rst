Setting up OS X
---------------

#. Install the `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__ package manager for installing non-desktop applications or utilities.
#. OS X only comes with Python 2 installed. Install the latest Python 3 release from the `website <https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/>`__.
#. Avoid installing Python packages at the system level, use virtual environments instead. See `here <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#introduction>`__
   why this is the recommended approach. There are several options for creating/managing virtual environments, we recommend `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`__.
#. Feel free to install and use your favorite text editor or IDE. If you don't have one, we recommend PyCharm to get started.
