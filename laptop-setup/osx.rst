Setting up OS X
---------------

#. Install the `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__ package manager for installing non-desktop applications or utilities.
#. OS X only comes with Python 2 installed. Install the latest Python 3 release from the `website <https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/>`__.
#. Avoid installing Python packages at the system level, use virtual environments instead. See `here <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#introduction>`__
   why this is the recommended approach. There are several options for creating/managing virtual environments, we recommend `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`__.
#. Feel free to install and use your favorite text editor or IDE. If you don't have one, we recommend PyCharm to get started.
#. Setup a pair of ssh keys with your Sophilabs email address. You can follow `this guide <https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/>`__
   if you're not sure how to do it. You will use these keys to push content to our Gitlab server or Github repositories, and also for accessing any remote
   server you need to access when working on a project.
