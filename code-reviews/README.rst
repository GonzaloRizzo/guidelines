Introduction
============

Code reviews are an important part of our workflow, they help in several purposes:

- Improve code quality and enforce good practices.
- Detect border cases and security risks before they are introduced.
- Encourage developers to collaborate and improve their skills from coding practices and patterns to communication and empathy.

Process
=======

Code reviews are done in the merge request stage.

The developer of the feature chooses another developer from the same team taking into account their experience
in the areas covered by the feature and other criteria.

Is the reviewer's duty to dedicate some time to read carefully and appropriately 
communicate about any doubt or issue found.

On the subject of "appropriateness", the reviewer should avoid personalism and focus on the code as it is, 
have patience and respect specially towards people with less knowledge on the subject, think carefully 
the feedback, always avoid judging and coercing, formulating questions is better for the developer's 
cognitive process and less deteriorating.

Remember to recognise merit in good solutions and good practices, this is as important as the evaluation part.
