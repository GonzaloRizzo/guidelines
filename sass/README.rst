Principles
==========

* Don't use ``#ids`` in rule selectors.
* Use one line per rule selector.
* Use lowercase with dashes for class name and add an space between
  the name and the bracket.
* Use 2 speaces for indentation.
* Use single quotes.
* Use lowercase with dashes for filenames.
* Extend from `%placeholders <http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/extending-placeholder-selectors-with-sass/>`__, never from a class.
* Don't abuse extend a placeholder in order to avoid side effects.
* Lines as possible, shorter than 80 characters. You can split them into several lines when necessary.
* Use colors expressed in HSL when possible, then RGB, then hexadecimal.
* Use media queries inside the selector.
* Use pseudo-elements '::after' and '::before' if you don't need link a action.
* Generate source map just for develop propose '/*# sourceMappingURL=screen.css.map */'.
* Use the flag !default in public libraries to safely override.
* Don't use the flag !global for root declarations.

Rule Formatting
===============

.. code:: scss

    .rule-formatting {
        // 1. Extends
        @extend %foo;

        // 2. Includes
        @include bar(foo);

        // 3. Properties order by name
        display: block;
        z-index: 10;
        ...

        // 4. Media queries
        @media #{$mobile} {
            ...
        }

        @media #{$tablet} {
            ...
        }

        // 5. Pseudo classes
        &:hover {
            ...
        }

        &:first-child {
            ...
        }

        // 6. Pseudo elements
        &::after {
            ...
        }

        &::before {
            ...
        }

        // 7. Selectors
        & > ... {
            ...
        }

        & ... {
            ...
        }
    }

Modules, partials, and vendor
-----------------------------

As you can see this divides the project into three basic types of files:
Modules, partials, and vendored stylesheets.

* The modules directory is reserved for Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to
  actually output CSS. Things like mixin declarations, functions, and variables.
* The partials directory is where the meat of my CSS is constructed.
* The vendor directory is for third-party CSS. This is handy when using
  prepackaged components developed by other people (or for your own components that are maintained in another project). jQuery UI and a color picker are examples of CSS that you might want to place in the vendor directory. As a general rule I make it a point not to modify files in my vendor directory. If I need to make modifications I add those after the vendored files are included in my primary stylesheet. This should make it easy for me to update my third-party stylesheets to more current versions in the future.
